This repository contains the code of a novel formulation for camera motion estimation that integrates RGB-D images and inertial data through scene flow. 
Assuming a rigid scene, our goal is to accurately estimate the camera's motion in a rigid 3D environment, along with the state of the inertial measurement unit (IMU). 
Our proposed method offers the flexibility to operate as a multi-frame optimization or to marginalize older data, thus effectively utilizing past measurements.
